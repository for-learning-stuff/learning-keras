Sequential
Created by passing list of layers to constructor

Input
A Keras tensor
shape=(input_dim,)

Embedding
A embedding vector is a matrix with vectorsenting each word. Can be trained from a vocab list, or the weights can be loaded.
Embedding output shape: (lines of data (shown as None), number of words, number of features for each)
output_dim: 

LSTM
LSTM can be used for time series (what we need it for), and sequence classification (sentiment analysis).
LSTM output shape: (lines of data (shown as None), number of "units")
"units" = output dim
Each row of input is one timestep in LSTM
The LTSM class has defines a call() with inputs as a parameter, that isn't __call__(). It takes inputs as a paramete, but also has other optional parameters.
Inherits from RNN

Model
Models have weights made up of the weights of the layers


one_hot integer encodes the words in a text, filtering out punctuation so the hash of 'done!' is the same as 'done'

batch_shape=(lines of (shown as None), dimension of features)
